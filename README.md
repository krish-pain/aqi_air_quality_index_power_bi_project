<h1>Air Quality Index Dashboard for Indian Regions</h1>

<h4>Overview:</h4>
       Air quality plays a crucial role in the health and well-being of communities and ecosystems. Monitoring air quality is essential to understand the concentration of pollutants that impact health, visibility, climate, and the environment. Poor air quality, especially due to high levels of particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) and gases like SO₂, NO₂, and CO, has been associated with respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and adverse environmental effects. This dashboard provides an interactive visualization of air quality data across different regions in India, helping users understand and analyze the pollution levels in their area.

<h4>Project Description:</h4>
     This project is a Power BI dashboard that displays the Air Quality Index (AQI) data for various regions in India. The data includes several chemical and particulate components that are significant determinants of air quality. By visualizing this data, users can observe regional AQI trends, identify pollution hotspots, and make informed decisions based on the historical and real-time data presented.

<h4>Data Analyzed:</h4>
        The data analyzed in this dashboard includes several key air quality components, such as:

<h5>PM2.5:</h5> Particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns, which can penetrate deeply into the lungs and affect respiratory and cardiovascular health.

<h5>PM10:</h5> Particulate matter smaller than 10 microns, associated with respiratory ailments and reduced air visibility.

<h5>SO₂:</h5>Sulfur dioxide, a gas that can irritate the respiratory system and contribute to the formation of particulate matter.

<h5>NO₂:</h5> Nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant that can affect lung function and lead to respiratory symptoms.

<h5>CO:</h5> Carbon monoxide, a harmful gas that can cause dizziness, confusion, and even unconsciousness in high concentrations.

<h5>O₃:</h5> Ground-level ozone, which can lead to respiratory issues and exacerbate asthma conditions.

<h4>Features of the Dashboard</h4>
<h5>Regional AQI Analysis:</h5> View and compare AQI across different regions in India.

<h5>Historical Data Trends:</h5> Analyze the trends in AQI and pollutant levels over time.

<h5>Component-wise Insights:</h5> Examine the contributions of different pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂, CO, O₃) to the overall AQI.

<h5>Interactive Filtering:</h5> Users can filter data by region, time, and pollutant type for specific insights.

<h4>Technologies Used</h4>
<h5>Power BI:</h5> For building interactive visualizations and data modeling.

<h5>Data Sources:</h5> The data sources include open-source repositories and governmental datasets on air quality across Indian regions.
